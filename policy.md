# PRIVACY POLICY

When the "highlighting" toggle is turned on, the Data Highlighter chrome extension sends the URL of any visited page to a server that returns the entities present on the page.  The server uses the [Newspaper3K API](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to pull the text from the page, and the [spaCy API](https://spacy.io/) to extract entities. The page content is not stored, nor is any browsing history or any personal account information.  Entity information is no longer kept in local storage after the user closes the tab or navigates away from the page.  Information from other tabs or windows outside of the current, active one is not accessed.  We do not collect any personally-identifying information, health information, financial/payment information, authentication information, personal communications, location information, web history, or user activity.  We do not sell or transfer data to third parties or use it for anything other the specified entity-extraction use case.
